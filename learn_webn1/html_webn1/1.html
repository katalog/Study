                    Request
                    For
                    Proposals has concluded with W3C awarding the project to Studio 24, a small, independent digital
                    agency in
                    the
                    heart of Cambridge, UK, founded in 1999.
                    The project covers a subset of the public-facing pages of our Website and will span the next 10
                    months.
                    Please, read more in our joint press release.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are aiming for this phase to scale well to cover the redesign expectations for the rest of the
                    site.
                    Future phases will include the Member and Team spaces, internal Work Groups homepages,
                    specifications
                    template,
                    mailing lists archives, W3C Community Groups and Business Groups.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top:45px;">
                    The current website was implemented ten years ago and is no longer as effective in supporting W3C’s
                    mission
                    and
                    goals as it could be. We believe that by implementing current web best practices and technologies,
                    revising
                    the
                    information architecture, creating a content strategy and revamping the visual design, we can
                    provide our
                    audiences with the best information in a more user-friendly fashion, motivate participation in the
                    organization,
                    and communicate the nature and impact of W3C more effectively.
